Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): Cross-sectional MRI Data in Young, Middle Aged, Nondemented, and Demented Older Adults. *Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19*(9), 1498–1507. https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2007.19.9.1498

Notes: Description:  This set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 100 of the included subjects over the age of 60 have been clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Additionally, a reliability data set is included containing 20 nondemented subjects imaged on a subsequent visit within 90 days of their initial session.

# Breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) data set

Path to the file: `"exercises/data/breast_cancer.csv"`

Credits: Street, W. N., Wolberg, W. H., & Mangasarian, O. L. (1993). Nuclear feature extraction for breast tumor diagnosis. *SPIE Proceedings*. https://doi.org/10.1117/12.148698

Notes: Description: Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Even though this data is not brain-related, it is still a nice example of the numerical values extracted from the image data.
