Buckner; Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS): Cross-sectional MRI Data in Young, Middle
Aged, Nondemented, and Demented Older Adults. *Journal of cognitive neuroscience* 2007; 19 (9): 1498–1507. doi:
https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2007.19.9.1498

Notes: Description:  This set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 100 of the included subjects over the age of 60 have been clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Additionally, a reliability data set is included containing 20 nondemented subjects imaged on a subsequent visit within 90 days of their initial session.

# Breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) data set

Path to the file: `"exercises/data/breast_cancer.csv"`

<center><img src="breast_cancer.png"></center>

Credits: W.N. Street, W.H. Wolberg and O.L. Mangasarian. Nuclear feature extraction for breast tumor diagnosis. *IS&T/SPIE 1993 International Symposium on Electronic Imaging: Science and Technology*, volume 1905, pages 861-870, San Jose, CA, 1993, doi: https://doi.org/10.1117/12.148698

Notes: Description: Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Even though this data is not brain related, it is still a nice example of the numerical values extracted from the image data.
