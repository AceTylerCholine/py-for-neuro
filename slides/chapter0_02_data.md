# Breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) data set

Path to the file: `"exercises/data/breast_cancer.csv"`

<center><img src="breast_cancer.png"></center>

Credits: W.N. Street, W.H. Wolberg and O.L. Mangasarian. Nuclear feature extraction for breast tumor diagnosis. IS&T/SPIE 1993 International Symposium on Electronic Imaging: Science and Technology, volume 1905, pages 861-870, San Jose, CA, 1993.

Notes: Description: Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

Credits: Marcus, D. S., Fotenos, A. F., Csernansky, J. G., Morris, J. C., & Buckner, R. L. (2010). Open access series of imaging studies: longitudinal MRI data in nondemented and demented older adults. *Journal of cognitive neuroscience*, 22(12), 2677–2684. https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn.2009.21407

Notes: Description:  This set consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. The subjects are all right-handed and include both men and women. 100 of the included subjects over the age of 60 have been clinically diagnosed with very mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Additionally, a reliability data set is included containing 20 nondemented subjects imaged on a subsequent visit within 90 days of their initial session.
